# Work Sample for Product Engineer

Thank you for your interest in my work sample. Below is an overview of the tasks I have completed based on the provided
requirements.

## Project Overview

This project enhances a template that includes TailwindCSS to make it more user-friendly and interactive. The following
features have been implemented:

1. **Loading Spinner Replacement**
2. **Client-Side Data Table Implementation**
3. **Bonus Features: Sorting and Editing**

## Features

### 1. Loading Spinner Replacement

-   **Description:** The existing loading spinner has been replaced with a custom picture/animation to improve the user
    experience.

### 2. Data Table Implementation

-   **Description:** A client-side data table was created to display data retrieved from `db/data.json`.
-   **Data Retrieval:** The data is fetched using the `axios` library (or the `fetch` API).
-   **Styling:** The table is styled using TailwindCSS to ensure a consistent and modern design.

### 3. Bonus Features

#### Sorting

-   **Description:** Users can sort the data by clicking on the column headers, allowing for a more interactive
    experience.

#### Editing

-   **Description:** An "Edit" button has been added to each row in the data table.
    -   Upon clicking "Edit," users can modify the data in the row.
    -   A "Save" button is provided to persist the changes. For demonstration purposes, the updated data is logged to
        the console.
